ctrl + o to auto-import whatever you need for ArrayList 
(or whatever you add)

0 dimensions: point
1 dim: line
2 dim: square
3 dim: cube

from 1D, we can talk length
from 2D, we can talk area
from 3D, we can talk volume

AWT
Advanced Windowing Toolkit

don't use the AWT rectangle (et al.) class; use your own (you need doubles, awt only uses int (pixel-space))

awt is out-dated but some of the primitives are still used for drawing lines and points and such

swing is the extended version: javax--> the x is for extended

swing is the status quo. it's what we're going to use

JavaFX is in xml and is intended to replace swing; we're not using it b/c a) practice java and b) don't learn xml

you're going to want to look for your own layout managers if you don't want to use the default flow version

create the panel(s) first and then the frame after

JFrame holds a JPanel to which we add canvas, buttons, etc.

paintComponent() method gives you access to the Graphics element

call repaint() to get java to call paintComponent() again

frame.pack() --> after you stick the panel in the frame, this makes the frame to be the size of the panel

ALWAYS:
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

we're going to override paintComponent()

drawOval --> an outline
fillOval --> a filled-in oval

java assumes you start at the upper-left edge-- even for the oval/ circle
